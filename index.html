  To use this, download to any directory on your computer. Unpack by changing to that
  directory and running<br><br><tt>tar xvf anim.tar</tt> <br><br>

  The manual including installation instructions is included in the tarball. <br><br>
  
  In short, 
  you may install on a Mac by running <tt>make anim-mac</tt> and <tt>make demos</tt>. 
  Because OSX has formally deprecated OpenGL 2, you will get compiler warnings, but 
  these shouldn't cause a problem. Copy the resulting
  <tt>anim</tt> binary to somewhere on your system path; you can do this automatically with
  <tt>sudo make install</tt>.<br><br>
  
  You may install on Linux by installing the <tt>freeglut3-dev</tt> and <tt>libglew-dev</tt>
  packages, then running <tt>make anim</tt> and <tt>make demos</tt>. Copy the resulting
  <tt>anim</tt> binary to somewhere on your system path; you can do this automatically with
  <tt>sudo make install</tt>.<br><br>
