  <h2>Things to do, part 1:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Think about what values for g and L you want to use, and fill them in </li>
    <li> Think about a sensible value for the timestep dt, and add it. (Remember computers
    are fast!)</li>
    <li> Set some initial conditions for your pendulum (and the stopwatch you are using
    to time it)</li>
    <li> Fill in the physics update: how do theta, omega, and t change during each timestep?</li>
    <li> Play with your parameters and see how the behavior changes? What happens for an 
      amplitude of 3 radians? Is this physical?</li>
      
  </ol>

<h2>Things to do, part 2:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Modify the condition on the while loop: how can you make the pendulum stop
    after one-half swing?</li>
    <li> The code will now print out the period and end. How does the period depend on the
    amplitude?</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Things to do, part 3a (if you have plenty of time and want to hack yourself):</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Fill in the missing pieces of the below code to run many simulations, one after the
      other, and compute the "period anomaly" for each</li>
    <li> Investigate the resulting plot of period anomaly vs. amplitude. How does this relate to broader physics ideas?</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Things to do, part 3b (if you are short on time and want to skip to the analysis):</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Run the below code. What is it doing?</li>
    <li>The "period anomaly" is the difference between the simulated period and the one 
      predicted by the small-angle approximation formula in the textbooks. The code will 
      plot it in real time. Explain the following features:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Why does the plot look "stair-stepped" at very low amplitude?</li>
	<li>Why is the anomaly quadratic in the angle for intermediate amplitude?</li>
	<li>Why does the anomaly increase faster than angle squared for very large angle?</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
